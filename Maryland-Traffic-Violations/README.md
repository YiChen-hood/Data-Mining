Data mining - hw4

In this hw4 of decision tree, I build two models of decision tree: Decision Tree Classifier with criterion entropy and Decision Tree Classifier with criterion gini index.
The accuracy score of its model is 0.5298. The accuracy score of its training set is 0.5287. These two values are similar.
